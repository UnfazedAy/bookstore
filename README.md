## Project Overview

The bookstore API provides the following features:

- Manage books, authors, and genres through CRUD operations.
- Filter and retrieve books by authors and genres.
- Establish relational data models to reflect the following relationships:
  - A book has one author and one genre.
  - An author can have multiple books.
  - A genre can include multiple books.

The project includes clear API documentation and a video walkthrough showcasing API functionality, schema design, and code organization.

## Requirements

- **Database**: MongoDB (used for data modeling and handling relations between books, authors, and genres).
- **Environment**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Documentation**: Postman documentation (linked or included in the repository).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UnfazedAy/bookstore.git
   cd bookstore

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
    NODE_ENV=development or production
    PORT=3000
    HOST='127.0.0.1'
    MONGODB_URI_DEV=mongodb://localhost:27017/bookstore_dev or your mongodb uri/bookstore_dev
    MONGODB_URI_PROD=mongodb://localhost:27017/bookstore_prod or your mongodb uri/bookstore_prod
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   - For development:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - For production:

     ```bash
     npm start

5. **Access the API**:

   The API is now running on `http://localhost:3000` or the specified port in the `.env` file.

6. **Test the API**:

   Use the provided Postman documentation to test the API endpoints and verify the functionality.
   Or directly test using this link [Postman Documentation Link](https://winter-sunset-776630.postman.co/workspace/Team-Workspace~6a134688-e66e-4b04-8caa-b6481e970bb5/collection/24981589-d0eb5199-5f53-417b-91f7-20e0a1b96b2c?action=share&creator=24981589&active-environment=24981589-58a94f7e-f785-470c-88ff-1656e57921cd)

## Database Structure

1. **Books**:
   - Fields: `title`, `description`, `author`, `genre`, `published_date`
   - Relationship: Linked to a single author and genre

2. **Authors**:
   - Fields: `name`, `bio`
   - Relationship: Can have multiple books

3. **Genres**:
   - Fields: `name`, `description`
   - Relationship: Can have multiple books

## Code Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `config/`: Database configuration and environment variables with logger setup
- `controllers/`: Controller functions / endpoints for each type of data (books, authors, genres)
- `models/`: Mongoose models for books, authors, and genres
- `routes/`: Express routes for each endpoint
- `helpers/`: helper functions and error handling
- `middlewares/`: Middleware functions for request validation and error handling
- `server.js`: Main file to start the server and connect to the database using Express.js
- `package.json`: Contains project dependencies and scripts
- `.env`: Environment variables for the project
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git
- `.eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration file
- `README.md`: Project documentation
